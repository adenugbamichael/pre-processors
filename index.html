    <h2>Front-end considerations</h2>
    <img src="https://bit.ly/3VUzJ7g" alt="blue print" />
    <p>
      Sometimes the framework you use is more opinionated about the folder
      structure and naming conventions. When your project has less
      <a href="">strict guidelines</a> on structure, then you can have fun
      making up your own. Here is a pretty common front-end setup for less
      opinionated frameworks, like React.

    <h2>Back-end considerations</h2>
    <img src="https://bit.ly/3F4vd0f" alt="crane" />
    <p>
      On the back-end, you’ll likely be more concerned with authentication and
      authorization for the data users have access to in the app and how you get
      and transfer that data to various places.
    </p>

    <p>
      REST APIs <br />
      When it comes to REST, most of your development will happen inside of a
      framework like Express, Next, Nest, or any of the other popular
      frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microservices <br />

      With microservices, you have a lot of independently running functions that
      get deployed as their own app or service. You don’t have to follow uniform
      conventions across microservices. You could have one
      <a href="">microservice built</a> with Express, another built with Nest,
      and another built in a different language like Python or Go. Because these
      projects are small, you can keep the structure simple, similar to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL <br />
      It’s commonly used when there are complex data structures that need to be
      displayed in the front-end. Although you’ll likely see it used to replace
      REST APIs as well.

    <h2>Types of projects</h2>
    <img src="https://bit.ly/3N42oD1" alt="wrong way" />
    <p>
      Organizing the core folder structure in a way that’s more specific to the
      type of project you’re working on can also be very helpful. An app built
      around FinTech will have different priorities and goals than an app built
      around recommending products to a user.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There’s different functionality you need to focus on depending on the
      exact type of app you’re working on. Some will have to comply with
      regulations like HIPAA or PCI and that can drive a lot of development
      decisions. How you manage data can also effect the way you handle your
      code choices.
